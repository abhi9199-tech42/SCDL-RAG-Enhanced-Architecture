## Introduction

The Intentional Semantic Reasoning Engine (ISRE) is an AI reasoning system that performs intentional reasoning by operating on semantic signals before language, using deterministic compression, structured intent graphs, and oscillatory decision dynamics, rather than probabilistic next-token prediction. This system treats language as merely an interface, not the core reasoning mechanism.

## Glossary

- **ISRE**: Intentional Semantic Reasoning Engine - the complete system
- **Semantic_Primitive**: Language-agnostic meaning units extracted from input
- **Intent_Graph**: Structured graph representation of goals, beliefs, constraints, and emotions
- **Reasoning_Engine**: The core intentional reasoning component that resolves intent conflicts
- **Oscillatory_Gate**: Mechanism that activates/deactivates reasoning paths over time
- **Semantic_Compressor**: Component that converts input into pre-linguistic semantic form
- **Output_Reconstructor**: Component that translates semantic decisions into language/actions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pre-Linguistic Semantic Compression

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to process meaning before language, so that reasoning is not biased by linguistic structures or tokens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any input (text, speech, symbols, sensor data) is received, THE Semantic_Compressor SHALL convert it into semantic primitives
2. WHEN processing input, THE Semantic_Compressor SHALL remove grammar, syntax, and language-specific bias
3. WHEN the same semantic meaning is provided in different languages, THE Semantic_Compressor SHALL produce identical semantic primitives
4. THE Semantic_Compressor SHALL operate deterministically (same input produces same semantic form)
5. WHEN semantic primitives are created, THE system SHALL retain only meaning-bearing signals

### Requirement 2: Intent Graph Construction

**User Story:** As a reasoning system, I want to represent intentions as structured graphs, so that I can perform explicit and inspectable reasoning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic primitives are received, THE system SHALL construct an Intent_Graph with nodes and edges
2. THE Intent_Graph SHALL contain nodes representing goal intent, context intent, query intent, and constraint intent
3. THE Intent_Graph SHALL contain edges representing causal, temporal, logical, and priority relations
4. WHEN intent conflicts exist, THE Intent_Graph SHALL explicitly represent these conflicts as graph structures
5. THE Intent_Graph SHALL be inspectable and modifiable by external systems

### Requirement 3: Designed Reasoning Engine

**User Story:** As an AI system, I want to perform intentional reasoning rather than statistical prediction, so that I can resolve intent conflicts deterministically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reasoning begins, THE Reasoning_Engine SHALL generate multiple reasoning paths in parallel
2. WHEN multiple reasoning paths exist, THE system SHALL use competitive selection based on intent satisfaction, constraint compliance, and semantic coherence
3. THE Reasoning_Engine SHALL use oscillatory gating mechanisms to activate and deactivate reasoning paths over time
4. WHEN reasoning paths compete, THE system SHALL prevent collapse into single biased paths
5. THE Reasoning_Engine SHALL combine deterministic logic rules with adaptive weighting based on feedback
6. THE Reasoning_Engine SHALL NOT predict text tokens during reasoning

### Requirement 4: World Knowledge Integration

**User Story:** As a reasoning system, I want to access external knowledge dynamically, so that I don't hallucinate or rely on embedded knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reasoning requires knowledge, THE system SHALL query external structured knowledge sources
2. THE system SHALL integrate physics rules, logical constraints, and domain-specific reasoning modules
3. WHEN knowledge is missing, THE system SHALL explicitly identify the knowledge gap
4. THE system SHALL maintain clear separation between reasoning processes and knowledge storage
5. WHEN domain-specific logic is needed, THE system SHALL use modular plug-in logic units

### Requirement 5: Semantic Reconstruction and Output

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive responses in natural language or actions, so that I can interact with the system naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reasoning is complete, THE Output_Reconstructor SHALL convert semantic decisions into language, code, or actions
2. THE Output_Reconstructor SHALL support multiple output languages and formats
3. WHEN the same semantic decision is made, THE system SHALL be able to express it in different formats
4. THE system SHALL maintain separation between reasoning completion and output generation
5. WHEN generating output, THE system SHALL translate rather than reason during generation

### Requirement 6: System Integration and Pipeline

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want all five layers to work as an integrated reasoning pipeline, so that the system performs coherent intentional reasoning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL process inputs through all five layers in sequence: Input → Compression → Intent Graph → Reasoning → Output
2. WHEN any layer fails, THE system SHALL provide diagnostic information about the failure point
3. THE system SHALL maintain semantic consistency across all layers
4. WHEN processing is complete, THE system SHALL provide traceability from input to reasoning to output
5. THE system SHALL operate as a single reasoning pipeline rather than independent components

### Requirement 7: Performance and Determinism

**User Story:** As a system user, I want consistent and reliable reasoning, so that the system behaves predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identical inputs are provided, THE system SHALL produce semantically equivalent outputs
2. THE system SHALL complete reasoning within acceptable time bounds for real-time applications
3. WHEN reasoning paths oscillate, THE system SHALL converge to a decision within finite time
4. THE system SHALL handle concurrent reasoning requests without interference
5. WHEN system resources are constrained, THE system SHALL gracefully degrade performance while maintaining correctness

### Requirement 8: Extensibility and Modularity

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want to extend and modify the reasoning capabilities, so that the system can adapt to new domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new semantic compression methods are needed, THE system SHALL support pluggable compression modules
2. WHEN new reasoning strategies are required, THE Reasoning_Engine SHALL support additional reasoning path generators
3. WHEN new output formats are needed, THE Output_Reconstructor SHALL support pluggable output modules
4. THE system SHALL provide APIs for external systems to inspect and modify Intent_Graphs
5. WHEN domain-specific knowledge is required, THE system SHALL support integration of new knowledge modules
